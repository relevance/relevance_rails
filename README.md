Relevance Rails
==============

Yo dawg, I heard you like automation, so I automated your automation so you can autopilot while you autopilot!

Rails 3 projects with every fiddly bit convened rather than configured. Includes

* HAML and SCSS
* RSpec 2 with Relevance config niceties
* Factory Girl
* Mocha configured for mocking
* Capistrano deploy recipes
* A VM deployment target under provision

Getting Started
---------------

````sh
    gem install relevance_rails
    relevance_rails new <your new project>
````

Caveats
-------

Only supports REE 1.8.7, Rails 3.1 and MySQL right now.

Improvements
------------

Fork, do your work, and issue a pull request.

Issues
------

Open a github issue and I'll look at it next Friday.
