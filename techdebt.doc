## Scroll dependency ordering is broken

AppScrolls uses the <=> operator to sort scrolls. This is suppossed to
ensure that the each scroll is ordered according to their before_run and
after_run settings.

The problem with this approach is that <=> only
compares siblings. If a scroll has a dependency but it's immediate
neighbors are not part of that dependency chain and the scrolls are
alreay in alpha order then no sorting will occur.

Instead the scrolls should be kept in a linkes list and when comparing
all scrolls that come before/after a given scroll should be considered
to see where in the run list the scroll must be inserted.

This would be a pretty significant change to AppScrolls. Given that we
are only using AppScrolls for loading scrolls, doing dependency
management and generating the template, I suggest that when we tackle
this issue we just go ahead and ditch AppScrolls completely. It's
codebase has been abandoned and is in an unreliable state.
